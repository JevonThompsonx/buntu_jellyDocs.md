# Buntu Jelly

Here I will keep notes for my future self of changes I've made here

## Drives

I currently have 5 drives in this computer
1. nvme for OS
2. nvme sata for downloads
3-5. HDDs for Media storage

## Setup 
I'll be using a setup that pools storage and hopefully also protects from crashes. Will drop more info later
